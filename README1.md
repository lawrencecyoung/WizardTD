# Jafr (Just a Friendly Reminder)

Jafr is a command-line application designed to help multiple users manage their tasks and meetings on a Unix-like operating system. Users can interact with Jafr to view, edit, and share reminders stored in text files.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3 installed on your machine.
- A Unix-like operating system.

## Usage

To run Jafr, execute `jafr.py` with the Python interpreter. The script requires one command-line argument which is the path (absolute or relative) to a given `passwd` file.

```sh
python3 jafr.py passwd
